I want to build a professional corporate volunteering matchmaking platform for the company Manuchar Per√∫. The project must be a full-stack web application in React with Tailwind CSS, hosted on Netlify, and use Firebase for authentication, database, and backend functions.

‚ùóÔ∏èImportant:

The entire platform must be in Spanish.

The psychological tests (Gallup Strengths and Eysenck Personality Inventory - EPI) must be implemented professionally, with real psychological logic behind the results and proper data processing to improve recommendation accuracy.

üí° Main Features
1. Authentication
Sign in and sign up with Firebase Auth (email & password).

Force password change on first login.

Two user roles: Employee and Administrator.

2. User Profile & Psychological Tests
After login, the user must complete:

Gallup Strengths Test (custom implementation).

Eysenck Personality Inventory (EPI).

Results must be stored in Firebase Firestore, with visual feedback.

Use results to generate a personalized volunteer profile.

3. AI-Based Matching
Use AI (OpenAI or similar) to suggest volunteering opportunities based on test results and user interests.

Divide activities into:

Labs de voluntariado: short, quick-impact actions (e.g., 1-day events).

Misiones sociales: long-term, skill-based volunteering.

4. Admin Dashboard
Dashboard showing:

Hours volunteered, SDG targets achieved (especially SDG 8 & 17), user participation.

Filters by location, department, type of project.

Impact metrics and satisfaction ratings in real time.

5. Badges, Levels & Certificates
Implement badges by participation level (e.g., beginner, intermediate, leader).

Use POAP blockchain to issue verifiable certificates.

Allow exporting and linking badges to LinkedIn or other resumes.

6. Recognition and Motivation
After each volunteering activity:

Ask for self-evaluation of skill development.

Reward with points, badges, and certificates.

Enable employees to nominate coworkers to do a volunteering mission.

Publish success stories in a blog-style impact wall.

7. Notifications
Weekly reminders via email using Firebase Functions.

In-app notifications for upcoming activities and recognition.

8. Security
Comply with Peruvian Data Protection Law.

Ensure encryption for sensitive data and private credentials.

9. Technologies
Frontend: React + Tailwind CSS

Backend: Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Functions, Storage)

AI: OpenAI or similar API for volunteer matching

Blockchain: POAP API for certificates

üóÇ Project Structure
Modular folder structure: auth/, tests/, matching/, dashboard/, components/, etc.

Add .env.template, README.md, and test coverage setup.

All code comments and labels in Spanish.

‚úÖ Testing
Add unit tests for:

Auth logic

AI matching function

Test result processing

Certificate generation

Dashboard statistics

Please make the UI professional, modern, clean, with a simple onboarding flow. Prioritize responsiveness and accessibility.
